When I was last in Cork in 2023 this didn’t exist. The hotel is in converted waterfront premises within a short walk of shops and restaurants and I can’t fault the room or the small restaurant. The only snag is if you have a car. The recommended parking is at the City Hall multi-storey, which is about half a mile away and the other side of the river. It’s also not very practical to stop a car outside to offload luggage. The walk to the car park is straightforward across a pedestrian footbridge across the river and then due east in a straight line crossing just one busy road. If park8ng overnight my tip is to not drive into the car park until after 7pm and remove your car before 8am. That way you get Q-Park’s night rate of €20. Park outside those times and it could cost you up to €44. Putting aside the inconvenience if you are touring with a car, the staff were all very friendly and seem like they enjoy being there and meeting people","published_at":"3 weeks ago","published_at_date":"2025-06-08T23:59:59","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":0,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":0,"is_local_guide":false,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJd016bnlRRRAB","review_link":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJd016bnlRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x51e109ea59ac28b1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCIwMznyQE%7CCgwIk7WfvwYQyNGmsgM%7C?hl=en-GB","name":"Gary Nugent","reviewer_id":"104121346917684425314","reviewer_profile":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104121346917684425314?hl=en-GB","rating":3,"review_text":"Spent two nights at the hotel with my partner and toddler.

Obviously there are road works and building work going on close to the hotel. But the q park car park they offer a discount on is quite a distance away. You can actually see another q park out the window of the hotel that is very close. However this is not the one. You’ve to talk past this and several other large car parks to get to the right one. Not ideal for anyone travelling with luggage or a child. Even a drop off/set down area for guests would be helpful but instead I’d to lug everything back and forth.

Courteous, polite and helpful staff.  The location was great.  Restaurants and shopping within 7-10 minute walks.  The breakfast buffet was very good with plenty of choices if you need to be gluten free. Didn’t see bread but also didn’t look.  Lots of fresh fruit, fruit compote, yogurt, eggs, sausages, bacon, potatoes.||The only things I want to mention is that the shower is a tub shower with a very high tub edge to climb in.  We are in our 60’s and 70 and physically fit so it wasn’t a problem. May be if you are disabled.  I don’t know if all of the rooms were the same.|Second.  We had a rental car and finding the parking lot was confusing.  It’s on a busy street so my husband pulled up close and I ran in to find out where to park.  It’s behind the building on Anderson street and you press a button to be let in.  It isn’t very big so if it’s full there is a public lot close by.  Parking is extra for both.  If this was explained in the confirmation my husband didn’t see it.|Third.  This is a busy street.  No air conditioning and when we opened the window the traffic noise was very loud so had to close it for sleep.","published_at":"a month ago","published_at_date":"2025-05-18T23:59:59","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":0,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":0,"is_local_guide":false,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VObkU5LWJnemYzQVhnEAE","review_link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186600-d206816-r1011037478?m=68573&staydates=2025_07_13_2025_07_14&uguests=1_2_0&supdv=unknown&supuc=IE&supul=en","name":"bearmom","reviewer_id":null,"reviewer_profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186600-d206816-r1011037478?m=68573&staydates=2025_07_13_2025_07_14&uguests=1_2_0&supdv=unknown&supuc=IE&supul=en","rating":null,"review_text":"Hotel was clean and service personnel were friendly.

I can’t comment on the room rate, since it  was included in a Gate1 tour package.  ||||The hotel is located on Anderson’s Quay, directly on the south bank of the Lee River.  It is located about a block east of the Cork bus station.  Numerous pubs and eating places are within walking distance.||||The actual lobby is not very big, but there are several seating arrangements. No issues with the check-in.||||Our room (103) was smallish by US standards and had a contemporary decor.  There was no closet, just an open shelving arrangement.  ||||We turned on the wall-mounted radiator, which really didn’t do much. (Luckily, the room became comfortable, temperature-wise.)||||A long credenza-type piece of furniture had two drawers and doubled as a desk.  A small flat-screen TV and coffee/tea fixings were on top.  An upholstered chair and round table were also in the room.||||There was no safe, nor a refrigerator.  And during our short stay we never really mastered  which switches controlled which lights.||||Our room came with two beds:  one queen (with four pillows) and one twin (with two pillows). They were flanked with night stands and wall-mounted reading lamps.  The beds were quite comfortable.||||TIP:  if you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room facing the back of the hotel, rather than Anderson’s Quay or N27.||||The bathroom was also somewhat small with minimal counter space.  A hair dryer was in a drawer in the room.  Liquid soap was by ZERO/o.||||There was a tub/shower combination.  Water pressure and temperature were fine once I figured out how to use them. Wall-mounted bottles of ZERO/o  body wash and shampoo/conditioner were provided.  Towels were nice and thick.|| ||TIP:  As is common in Europe, the bottom of the tub is a few inches above the floor, making exiting the tub awkward.||||Breakfast was included with our room and was served in the restaurant off the main lobby.  A full selection of cold and hot cold  selections were offered, including full Irish/English breakfast items.  I was especially excited to see scones, but disappointed that I didn’t see any clotted cream. ||||A blast from the past:  hard copies of the local newspaper were available in the lobby. ||||Overall, we found our room to be adequate and comfortable and would have no qualms staying there again||||For more specific details and pictures, visit the hotel’s website.","published_at":"3 weeks ago","published_at_date":"2025-06-10T23:59:59","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":0,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":0,"is_local_guide":false,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25odWRYVm1jWEZGVFRWa1ZGRnFVWFJOYWtSMFMwRRAB","review_link":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25odWRYVm1jWEZGVFRWa1ZGRnFVWFJOYWtSMFMwRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x91d38e295cbcb19d!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOnhudXVmcXFFTTVkVFFqUXRNakR0S0E%7C0cK7t2uBNJu%7C?hl=en-GB","name":"Turais","reviewer_id":"101388643592104169984","reviewer_profile":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101388643592104169984?hl=en-GB","rating":1,"review_text":"The rooms are okay although a little bit expensive.

No one came to take away the glasses, even though the bar was very empty. The two young employees were just wandering around slowly and never even looked in out direction (we sat next to the entry, not hidden somewhere.

The location is perfect with restaurants, shopping, and tour pick-up points very close.  Our first room was beautiful, with plenty of room for luggage without injuring your shins or toes.  We stayed a few nights for the vacation part of the trip, then had to switch rooms for the business part of the trip.  I want to warn anyone considering this hotel that the rooms booked by my husband's company were the small rooms.  The word small as a descriptive word is being generous.  It will be very uncomfortable unless you have very little luggage because your trip is short.  We were in Ireland for 10 days, so we each had a large suitcase, and I was sure I would have to move it to the hallway to open it.  The room was very nice and clean, but wow.  It was tiny.  Especially compared to the previous room.  But, with that in mind, if you have just a backpack or small carry-on bag, you shouldn't damage too many body parts maneuvering around the room.  The employees were outstanding, and because of the beautiful hotel's location, I had to give it five stars just for those reasons.  However, I feel I needed to warn about the small rooms.  Go for the bigger rooms if they're available.","published_at":"a month ago","published_at_date":"2025-05-22T23:59:59","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":0,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":0,"is_local_guide":false,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VKalp3TmFGMmRIYVhBEAE","review_link":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VKalp3TmFGMmRIYVhBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x9d4f035efd53d30f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEJjZwNaF2dHaXA%7CCgwIp9z3wQYQ2MrvtwE%7C?hl=en-GB","name":"Feisty Grandma","reviewer_id":"110601371236475084898","reviewer_profile":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110601371236475084898?hl=en-GB","rating":4,"review_text":"Very new hotel as of six weeks ago.

Water: On checking into our room I went to use the bathroom.I went to wash my hands with the hot water, the water which came from the tap was of a brown colouring. When I went to dry my hands with the towel on the holder; I removed the towel and along with the towel came the holder from the wall; broken. I asked my sister to look at the water she clearly confirmed the water was brown. I went to check the hot water tap in the bath and the same thing happened. I rang down to reception to be told that there is an issue with all hotels in Cork and to let the water run for a few minutes and it will be fine. Not acceptable on any level. We met friends in the evening that were staying in 6 different locations in Cork I asked if anybody else having this issue to be told by each and every one of them NO. This issue of having brown water coming from the hot tap continued through the stay.|Breakfast: On check in went to book breakfast for the Sun at 7.30am to be told that there is no breakfast on a Sun until 8am it clearly states on the website that breakfast begins at 7.30am. I said this to the lady in reception to be given a shrug of her shoulders and we were offered a packed breakfast which we accepted. On Sun when we went to check out breakfast was clearly been severed. I questioned why we were unable to book breakfast for the time as it was been served I was told that because we were not part of a tour we were unable to get an early breakfast. This is not good enough why are certain clients getting preference over others?|Condition of the room: From the photos which I have attached there is no way in any hotel that the level of cleanliness we received in the hotel rooms was acceptable. The dampness in the bathroom, the dirt around the shelving in the bathroom and bed room, the state of the coving and the dirt on it and in particular the dirt around the window and on the curtains was the worst that I have ever encountered in any hotel photos below say it all.","published_at":"a week ago","published_at_date":"2025-06-20T23:59:59","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":0,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":0,"is_local_guide":false,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VKVDh6S2FELS16M1FnEAE","review_link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186600-d294400-r1013129867?m=68573&staydates=2025_07_13_2025_07_14&uguests=1_2_0&supdv=unknown&supuc=IE&supul=en","name":"Yuffd","reviewer_id":null,"reviewer_profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186600-d294400-r1013129867?m=68573&staydates=2025_07_13_2025_07_14&uguests=1_2_0&supdv=unknown&supuc=IE&supul=en","rating":null,"review_text":"Had room with double bed and asked re upgrade to one with king bed and willing to pay the extra but was informed there were no beds bigger than double in the hotel.

However, if in Cork, I would choose this hotel again.","published_at":"a week ago","published_at_date":"2025-06-19T16:54:43","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":75,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":19,"is_local_guide":true,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[{"name":"Trip type","value":"Holiday"},{"name":"Travel group","value":"Couple"},{"name":"Rooms","value":5},{"name":"Service","value":5},{"name":"Location","value":5},{"name":"Hotel highlights","value":"Romantic"}],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21OYWR6SnJiVVJhWXpoQ2NUSklkVGhITFhoVldtYxAB","review_link":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21OYWR6SnJiVVJhWXpoQ2NUSklkVGhITFhoVldtYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe6771ec9fc8a5bbf!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOmNadzJrbURaYzhCcTJIdThHLXhVWmc%7C0cMZBD_kN-f%7C?hl=en-GB","name":"Beatriz Garcez","reviewer_id":"100445466593806423910","reviewer_profile":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100445466593806423910?hl=en-GB","rating":5,"review_text":"I’ve just been to Helena’s restaurant.

While initially lovely, it’s not a true suite; compact room overall, with a stylish but cramped bathroom.\n\nA few major disappointments:\nThe bed: Advertised as a king, it’s clearly two twins pushed together. While this may be common in Europe, it is usually stated in the room description. The dip between the beds made it difficult to sleep comfortably and felt like a cheap shortcut.\n\nThe Vitality Suite/Escape Spa: The dressing rooms reeked of mildew and wet towels; it was an unbearable stench. The spa itself had visible mold, stains, and worn-down facilities. We turned around and left.\n\nHousekeeping and Cleanliness: We returned at 4pm to find our room “cleaned” but the door had been left ajar, with the lock engaged so it couldn’t close. Anyone could have walked in. When we reported it to the manager, Brenda, her response was a casual, “I’m sorry,” with no sense of urgency or accountability. The room itself wasn’t clean: the floors hadn’t been touched, garbage bins were still full, and the bed was made with sheets that had holes.\n\nTo top it all off, our coffee machine was broken and we had to get someone to come look at it to confirm that it was not working before getting sent another. There were houseflies in our room when we arrived; three so far. For a room marketed as one of the hotel’s best, this level of cleanliness is completely unacceptable. It only added to the overall feeling that attention to detail and guest comfort are simply not priorities here.\n\nThe final straw came tonight when we returned from dinner to find no chocolates or whiskey; amenities clearly listed in our package. When we asked at the front desk, we were told it’s only offered at check-in, which contradicts the description on their website (I’ll include photos). I expressed my disappointment, and the response was simply, “Ok, have a good evening.” For a hotel aiming for high standards, this was a complete letdown.\n\nWe spoke with Michael, the night manager. He was sympathetic but said there was nothing he could do. He offered to leave a note for the morning management team to see if they might adjust our room rate, so we’ll wait to see if anyone follows up.\n\nWe’re giving two stars only because of the initial warm welcome we received in the form of a card left in our room. Otherwise, this hotel fails to deliver on the standards it advertises. It’s simply not worth the money, and certainly not fit for any special occasion.\nAs it stands I would not recommend spending your money or time here for any special occasion.\n\n(Photos posted: spa conditions, robe damage, and our unsecured, uncleaned room.

Also, the staff is nice, albeit extremely unhelpful. The free parking was appreciated.\nOverall, I am so disappointed that I wasted $450 and two nights of my life here. I am by no means a fancy traveller nor do I have high expectations when I travel. I have stayed in hostels all over Europe, and I would have gladly rather been in any one of those hostels.\nThe beds were extremely uncomfortable, the hotel is very loud (both from other guests and from street noise outside), and there was a giant streetlight shining directly into our room from 10:00pm to 5:00am.\nThe room is very small, and there is no storage (I even asked for a luggage rack as was declined). There is nowhere to put your toiletries in the bathroom and just a single hook for towels, so the second person has literally nowhere to put their sopping wet towel.\nWhoever is reading this: I do not know you, but please please do yourself a favor and spend the extra 50 euros per night to stay anywhere else. You owe it to yourself.","published_at":"a month ago","published_at_date":"2025-05-22T20:27:52","response_from_owner_text":"Many thanks ","response_from_owner_ago":"a month ago","response_from_owner_date":"2025-05-28T12:37:53","total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":3,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":1,"is_local_guide":false,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[{"name":"Rooms","value":1},{"name":"Service","value":1},{"name":"Location","value":4}],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VOZlE0SS1jNVl6MmN3EAE","review_link":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VOZlE0SS1jNVl6MmN3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x17fa76eba4131782!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKENfQ4I-c5Yz2cw%7CCgwIh5bkwAYQkKbuvgE%7C?hl=en-GB","name":"Ana Paula Campos","reviewer_id":"110531322275017777659","reviewer_profile":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110531322275017777659?hl=en-GB","rating":5,"review_text":"I have absolutely nothing to complain about.

The rooms are incredibly outdated, basic and small. The doors to the rooms use night latch locks rather than coded cards.

After walking in and seeing the room for the first time my partner and I agreed to go out so as to avoid being in the room. The car park was very small and strangely laid out, so if you do make the mistake of staying here be careful pulling in and out.

There was a young man who was extremely helpful and gave him some coffee even though breakfast wasn't quite ready to be served.\n\nA little later that morning, my husband complimented the young man to the same clerk that checked us in. She went on and on about how he shouldn't have done that and how she was going to have to \"instruct the staff\" not to do that again. Geez... she would not shut up about it. My husband, thinking that he was doing a good thing by complimenting a staff member, felt absolutely awful that he may have gotten that young man in trouble.\n\nThere was a different young woman during breakfast, who got to know my husband. She was awesome. By the way, the breakfast buffet is phenomenal!\n\nThe service in the main restaurant was not good. After sitting there for about 10 min., we finally had to flag down a woman to get service - to just get something to drink. And the restaurant wasn't busy with maybe 4 other couples there. The tea I ordered was just water - there was no tea, and it took forever to get the food. The food, once we got it, was good.\n\nThen we had to try to find someone to get our ticket so we could pay for our meal. When we tried to charge it to our room, the young lady said we couldn't charge to your room. I went to the front desk to the same clerk that checked us in, and she said, \"You didn't give me a credit card.\" My response was,\"You didn't ask for one.\" I was just too fed up to say anymore.\n\nThe room was great, but the beds and the pillows are incredibly hard. Nothing fluffy to them. The housekeeping staff was very nice and helpful.","published_at":"2 months ago","published_at_date":"2025-04-03T13:38:50","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":44,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":0,"is_local_guide":true,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[{"name":"Rooms","value":2},{"name":"Service","value":2},{"name":"Location","value":4}],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRcks3dXpnRRAB","review_link":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRcks3dXpnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x1975bdaded10640d!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCQrK7uzgE%7CCgwI7IeSvgYQ4MTB9QE%7C?hl=en-GB","name":"Kelsey Duckworth","reviewer_id":"111795345992032656638","reviewer_profile":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111795345992032656638?hl=en-GB","rating":4,"review_text":"Had a 3 night stay here.

Instead, use the hotel's preferred and discounted parking across the bridge.|Room service was average and they were really slow to deliver. |Really comfy beds and we slept well.|It's not for you if you want peace and quiet. We could hear the live band from the bar outside the hotel which started at 10.30pm. It didn't bother us but might bother some people.","published_at":"a month ago","published_at_date":"2025-05-26T23:59:59","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":0,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":0,"is_local_guide":false,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[],"review_photos":[]}],"detailed_reviews":[],"query":"hotels cork city"}

From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the beautifully designed and impeccably clean rooms. They were spacious, comfortable, and thoughtfully decorated—every detail made it feel like a refined, relaxing retreat after a day of sightseeing.\n\nThe hotel strikes a perfect balance between historic charm and modern comfort. The staff were incredibly warm and welcoming, always ready to assist with a smile or offer helpful local recommendations. Its location is another major plus—perfectly situated in the heart of Cork, we were able to walk to fantastic restaurants, shops, and cultural spots with ease.\n\nThe only small downside was the bar connected to the hotel. While lively and popular, it did bring a bit of noise in the evenings. It wasn’t overwhelming, but light sleepers might want to keep that in mind.\n\nStill, this minor inconvenience didn’t take away from what was otherwise a fantastic experience. Hotel Isaacs offers luxury, convenience, and excellent service, and we’d happily stay here again.","published_at":"a month ago","published_at_date":"2025-05-23T18:42:26","response_from_owner_text":"Hi Joshua\nThank you for your superb feedback and delighted you really enjoyed your time spent with us. \nThank you for your valued business. \nKind regards\nClement Gleeson\nGeneral Manager \n","response_from_owner_ago":"a month ago","response_from_owner_date":"2025-05-30T09:58:44","total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":21,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":125,"is_local_guide":true,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[{"name":"Trip type","value":"Holiday"},{"name":"Travel group","value":"Friends"},{"name":"Rooms","value":5},{"name":"Service","value":5},{"name":"Location","value":4},{"name":"Hotel highlights","value":"Luxury"}],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VOSFVyTVA5dkktNWl3RRAB","review_link":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VOSFVyTVA5dkktNWl3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x866ed163ad9577eb!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKENHUrMP9vI-5iwE%7CCgwI4K_DwQYQ4J7btgI%7C?hl=en-GB","name":"Christina Fread","reviewer_id":"104053669705958615045","reviewer_profile":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104053669705958615045?hl=en-GB","rating":5,"review_text":"Located within walking distance to the bus/train station, this gem is a very luxurious suite with a variety of rooms from family suites, to doubles to singles.

Despite weeks of telephone calls and emails, we got absolutely no where. Last minute dot com requested a further £800 for the new dates at this lovely hotel.||We decided to forfeit the £200 we had originally paid and booked another hotel in Cork. We spent 1 night at that hotel and didn't have the best experience. The air conditioning was noisy, the room was dirty and the staff unsympathetic. We decided to walk across the city to The Residence Inn Marriott and tell them about the room we had paid for, for the following week- and that we were getting nowhere at all with who we booked with (Last minute dot com)||We hoped they had availability for our final night of enjoying Cork. |That's where Aisling, Triesh and Sam come in!|They spent more than 90 minutes trying to get through to last minute dot com and resolve our issue.

We even had the original room we wanted.|Sam provided a sense of calm over the entire 90 minutes. He was an excellent team player, checking in on Triesh and Aisling, and offering us coffee whilst we waited (anxiously)||Our room was a studio room. It was absolutely immaculate. The bed was super comfortable, a hot shower, and plenty of storage and kitchen facilities. We wish we could have stayed longer.||Breakfast was hot, beautifully cooked. Well stocked. We got to use the gym too and there was a wide variety of equipment, as well as a tv and water machine in there.||Only 5 minutes walk from gorgeous bars and pubs, The Residence Inn Marriott, Cork, is by far the best hotel experience we have ever had.

Even with the windows closed you can hear people talking on the street. If someone is unloading a truck on the street, theres no sleeping through that. The semi parking garage cement everywhere vibe gives you a 'bunker feel'... which was an interesting decoration choice.\n\nOther than some nit picking stuff, you'd be hard pressed to find a better hotel in Cork.

Pro-tip - the company might think to buy a highly visible ad in the railway station telling arriving guests to use the back entrance of Kent Station which is next door to the hotel, thereby avoiding a longer walk out of the station's front door up the hilly road (lots of hills in Cork, as I noticed being a Dub)||Staff are very friendly and the hotel has a relaxed, informal vibe similar to the Generator hostels (although obviously the Dean Cork is a high-end hotel, not a hostel).   When I first walked in I said to myself \"I'm not nearly cool enough for here\" but I was very pleasantly surprised. Staff are genuinely committed to looking after the customers to their very best ability.   Premises including toilets are spotless throughout||Restaurant on the top floor has a great view over Cork (it reminds me of the old Claddagh Grill in the Great Southern Hotel, Galway, back when dinosaurs roamed the earth) and serves a haute-cuisine à la carte menu with a few vegan options.  Service is until 21:00hrs which I liked a lot.   ||Breakfast is cooked to order (no buffet, thankfully) and was amazing at all times||Big plus: the bedrooms have direct USB sockets of the B and C class - this is a big thing for people from places other than Ireland or Britain.||Bedrooms, which are very highly soundproofed, have a Bluetooth speaker and the telly can be put onto YouTube||My bedroom, which was the basic, did not have a wardrobe or ironing board - I assume that ironing boards, irons etc are available upon request||I want to emphasise that for the four days that I stayed here, the terrific, genuinely friendly and kind staff went above and beyond the basics to do everything they could to give me a great time, which I had, and for which I remain most grateful.   One goes to pretentious places where they are putting on an act - this was not the case in the Dean Cork, the staff were really nice people and a credit to the management.   This is particularly important in city-centre hotels (in a previous review I also commend the staff of a Donegal golf hotel but such attentive service is less usual in urban hotels)||Saving the best for last:- the swimming pool is the most beautiful, well designed hotel pool that I have ever come across - it is delightful. I had not planned to use the pool much - that was not the purpose of the trip - but it was so nice I could not stay away.   Excellent full gym and other sports / gym facilities with classes   ||Well recommended - I look forward to returning","published_at":"2 weeks ago","published_at_date":"2025-06-16T23:59:59","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":0,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":0,"is_local_guide":false,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VQMkM3Snk2OGViMkh3EAE","review_link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186600-d23013097-r1009106246?m=68573&staydates=2025_07_13_2025_07_14&uguests=1_2_0&supdv=unknown&supuc=IE&supul=en","name":"Y4110AWlisab","reviewer_id":null,"reviewer_profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186600-d23013097-r1009106246?m=68573&staydates=2025_07_13_2025_07_14&uguests=1_2_0&supdv=unknown&supuc=IE&supul=en","rating":null,"review_text":"Absolutely amazing experience in this hotel.

highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Cork, Ireland. Not only is it beautiful with clean rooms, but the service is incredible! Here are some details:||-The restaurant is amazing. I went for breakfast every day and was greeted kindly and served the most delicious food and drink. One of the staff, Emma, was particularly wonderful, and always made sure I was taken care of during my entire meal. The restaurant manager was also very kind and fun. They completely took care of my special dietary needs.||-The rooms are very clean and the cleaning staff does an impeccable job when they take care of your room. And there are shelves in the room!

There are also a lot of nice and cozy places to relax, and the decor is beautiful.||-This hotel is tucked in a beautiful spot in Cork, with very close access (5-15 min walk for most) to many attractions, restaurants, and historical sites.

We were really looking forward to getting away together to the 4 star river Lee hotel. Upon check in we were very disappointed with our rooms. The decor was very shabby and definitely not that of a 4 star hotel. The chairs were grubby and the curtains stained. We found someone else’s dirty bobble left in our room. They room didn’t even provide a coffee machine just a kettle! I will say that the beds are very comfortable. |We ate in the hotel and the food was nice and tasty - service was a bit slow.|We proceeded to the lobby to have drinks - we were told at the lobby bar that we could only order certain cocktails there and would have to order the ones we wanted in the bar and they would bring them out. I proceeded to do this but when I ordered at the bar I had to wait until they were made. I then explained that I couldn’t carry them all out to which I was told it’s ok they would mind them and I could come back! All in all I could not recommend this hotel- we paid €300 for a shabby double room with no breakfast included. I had stayed in much better 3 star hotels for a fraction of the price. Very disappointed as we had high expectations and were really looking forward to a lovely weekend away.","published_at":"2 weeks ago","published_at_date":"2025-06-16T23:59:59","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":0,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":0,"is_local_guide":false,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VKTC13SWVmdnFYckVBEAE","review_link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186600-d587469-r1013185629?m=68573&staydates=2025_07_13_2025_07_14&uguests=1_2_0&supdv=unknown&supuc=IE&supul=en","name":"helenbR1143OC","reviewer_id":null,"reviewer_profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186600-d587469-r1013185629?m=68573&staydates=2025_07_13_2025_07_14&uguests=1_2_0&supdv=unknown&supuc=IE&supul=en","rating":null,"review_text":"We had a lovely meal (bar food) outside in the terrace.

The Room\nWe booked a 4-bed room — the beds were quite old, and the room itself was extremely small. For four people, it was definitely not suitable. We could barely move around without bumping into each other. Every time someone needed to go to the bathroom, the rest of us had to move. We felt more like homeless people than tourists visiting a city.\n\n2. Lounge with TV\nPoorly maintained, and due to the furniture, it looked very old and messy. I wouldn’t even call it a lounge — I’d rather stay in the tiny room than relax in that space.\n\n3. Kitchen\nThere’s a kitchen next to the lounge. It includes ovens, a stove, fridges, and a microwave so you can cook your own meals. However, due to how everything looked and was arranged, it felt very uninviting. I’d honestly rather pay €20 at a restaurant than cook in a kitchen that isn’t well-maintained.\n\n4. “Dining Area”\nWe expected a proper room where all guests could sit and eat. Instead, we ended up eating in a small space on high tables you usually see in bars. It felt more like we came for drinks than for breakfast.\nIf you want a good breakfast, I recommend going out instead. If you choose to eat at the hostel, you can only expect small spreads, toast, cereal, and coffee/juice. To be clear, it wasn’t a proper meal and we didn’t feel full afterwards.\n\nAll in all, after our stay we realized that we only paid for the location — not for a comfortable room, a nice dining space, or a proper chill-out area.\n\nThe only positive thing was that the staff were polite and explained all the rules clearly.\n\nIf comfort and a pleasant stay aren’t important to you, then I’d recommend this hostel just as a place to sleep. But for those who are looking for a realistic price for realistic services — meaning, you get what you pay for — I strongly suggest going somewhere else.\n\nIf you're planning to head to Dublin after Cork, I highly recommend the Clink Hostel — a big step up in every way.","published_at":"a month ago","published_at_date":"2025-05-21T13:27:06","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":27,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":51,"is_local_guide":true,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[{"name":"Rooms","value":2},{"name":"Service","value":3},{"name":"Location","value":5}],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VNeUR1UGo1ei0zV0VREAE","review_link":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VNeUR1UGo1ei0zV0VREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x2692aa928f44217b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEMyDuPj5z-3WEQ%7CCgwIt663wQYQsIKHxgM%7C?hl=en-GB","name":"Tanja Žanić","reviewer_id":"118412010648273587849","reviewer_profile":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118412010648273587849?hl=en-GB","rating":2,"review_text":"If you're only looking for a place to crash and don’t care much about comfort, this hostel might do the job.

Kitchen is ok for cooking only. Has no window.\nThe \"TV lounge\" is not the cozy place you might imagine. It's a clean windowless space with a wall-mounted TV and several bar stools.\n4-bed-dorms are tiny, dark, clean, functional. Very loud ventilation shaft right outside window, loud even with window closed. Still, it's OK for sleeping so long as you use earplugs. Each bed has its own lamp but no curtains.\nBeds are strangely short, even for me - I'm1.63m - and not too comfortable. Matresses should really really be replaced.\nStaff are friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to take one star off my initial 3 star review. Room was incredibly hot with heating on full throttle all night. Every time I turned the radiator down, one person in my room would turn it on full again.\nWhy's the heating on all night anyway in late april?\nHeating in bathroom couldn't be turned off at all.\nI spoke to two different members of staff about this, both seemed to be very understanding and promised to turn the heating's timer off for the next night. Neither of them did.\n\nOther guests were very inconsiderate - even for a hostel. There is no need to bang the doors all night (they're self-closing doors, so this is, at least in part, the hostel's fault), nor to pee standing up every single time you use the shared, mixed bathroom, and make a big mess.\n\nI stayin hostels frequently when travelling, and I use earplugs, so I'm usually alright for sleep. In this hostel, I could barely sleep 3 hours due to overheating and banging doors all night.\nOf course, the hostel doesn't encourage this kind of behaviour, but it is the way it is, and they don't do anything to stop it.","published_at":"Edited 2 months ago","published_at_date":"2025-04-23T01:47:11","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":32,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":3,"is_local_guide":true,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[{"name":"Trip type","value":"Holiday"},{"name":"Travel group","value":"Solo"},{"name":"Rooms","value":2},{"name":"Service","value":2},{"name":"Location","value":4}],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURJOV95Wm5nRRAB","review_link":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURJOV95Wm5nRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x2692aa928f44217b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMDI9_yZngE%7CCgsI7YfwvwYQwLz0Hw%7C?hl=en-GB","name":"Alo Ines","reviewer_id":"114079290974382247878","reviewer_profile":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114079290974382247878?hl=en-GB","rating":3,"review_text":"Location is great, also the breakfast that’s included.

The only thing we missed was having a fridge in the room.||The service was truly outstanding. Every staff member we encountered was kind, friendly, and eager to help. But what really made this stay special was how dog-friendly the hotel is. We were blown away by the thoughtful touches — our dogs received gift bags at check-in with a toy, treat, and bandana! In our room, there was a dog bed, blanket, and bowls already waiting.||The hotel has reasonable and respectful pet policies: dogs must be leashed, not left alone in the room, and aren’t allowed in the main restaurant, but they are welcome in the bar and breakfast area. We were seated to the side to be considerate of others, and it worked out perfectly. Our dogs were so happy and comfortable — and that meant the world to us.||Breakfast was another highlight, especially for someone with celiac. They offered gluten-free bread with a dedicated toaster, plus individually packaged GF scones, muffins, and brownies. There was also a large selection of hot and cold items, along with a menu you could order from. The only improvement we’d suggest is offering freshly squeezed orange juice — but that’s a small detail in an otherwise fantastic setup.||Highly recommend this hotel, especially if you’re traveling with pets or need great gluten-free options.

What a HUGE disappointment. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the concierge who was just too overly friendly and in your face telling us about the wonderful service we would receive and if we needed anything, he was always there to answer questions. Never saw him again the entire trip. Then at check in, we were given a handicap room….room was tiny but nicely decorated and the bathroom was huge….but….it was really set up for someone in a wheelchair and there was only a cheap curtain for the shower. We felt bad about taking a room that someone else may actually need so we asked to be moved. We were then moved to a regular room….not as bright and light and nicely decorated as the handicap room (felt like a orange/gray colored dungeon) and the new bathroom was ridiculously tiny with a tub/shower combo that you had trouble trying to get out of b  the sides of the tub were so high and no counter space for toiletries. For something that touts itself as a 5 star hotel, where’s the AC?!! The rooms are quite stuffy and if you open the windows, the noise is just too much.  Sucked it up since we were only staying for two days. Then the breakfast buffet….breads were definitely stale and we’ve had better food at a Holiday Inn Express.  Decided to order off the menu the next day….waited over 30 min for our food and said forget it and walked out. They say they provide great customer service but that was just lip service, their actions (or lack of) said otherwise. Gave a two star because of the awesome view of Cork at night.

Service was excellent, staff was quick to unload all our luggages once we parked and carried all of them to our rooms. We didn’t had to lift a finger whether checking in or out. Check in was smooth and rooms were comfortable though we did not expect one of the rooms to have no air conditioner, as we booked on the assumption the hotel will be fully air conditioned. So do check the details when booking. But it was not a big problem as Ireland even in summer is cool. Breakfast was great - with nice views and Irish breakfast buffet, as well as various hot items freshly cooked and served to the table - the oats were really nice. The hotel amazingly has a cinema even though we didn’t get to try it.

Confused staff that didn't seem to know the building or the business they were running. You really got the feeling it was the first day on the job except for one of the young women who actually was helpful.

Was so accommodating, kind and funny. We actually booked to stay at Clon Ross, and upon arrival was told we would be staying at Oaklands instead which is a 1 min walk up the road. The house was very old, but very homely. Our room was small but enough for us. The shower was a decent size, but the door to get into it is very small.

We rented an apartment with four rooms. Upon arrival, we discovered the dishwasher was full of dirty dishes, the refrigerator wasn't working, the lights were flickering, and the door to what seemed like a utility room was open, releasing hot air and a lot of dust.\n\nI went to the reception to report these issues, and later a woman from reception and a man who seemed to be the manager came up to our apartment to inspect. They said the dishwasher wasn’t working due to an error, they would fix the flickering light after turning off the electricity, the refrigerator would start cooling after adjusting the control, and they would lock the utility room door. I requested a room change, but the man said this was the best apartment and since we had already checked in, it had become a private space, so they couldn’t move us. He assured us they would fix everything.\n\nWe washed the dishes ourselves and after grocery shopping and returning about an hour later, the utility room door was still open, and the refrigerator still wasn’t working. I went back to reception to ask the female staff to call the male manager, but he had already left for the day. The female staff came up again to check the issues and then offered to move us to a neighboring unit on the same floor, which was vacant and had eight rooms. We were given keycards to four of the eight rooms. We wated time moving our groceries and unpacked items. Although the female staff apologized, she did not seem genuinely sorry.\n\nAfter dinner, we were chatting with our friends. Around 2 AM, a man suddenly entered our living room and asked how many rooms we had rented. We were very surprised as we had not been notified about this beforehand, but one of our friends answered that we had rented four rooms. The man left immediately, and at that moment, I accidentally cut my hand on the rim of a glass while washing dishes.\n\nI went down to find the man to ask for a band-aid and to understand why he had come in. The man was very aggressive and said it was his job to check if the oven was on and if there were any issues, and that there had been complaints about us being too noisy. He also said it was wrong to use a fire extinguisher to open the door for ventilation. We apologized for our mistakes. We wanted to ask why he entered without knocking or why he didn’t complain about the noise when he came to us, but he kept cutting us off with an aggressive attitude, so we couldn’t say anything. I explained my injury and requested a Plaster. The man continued to ask mockingly, \"Why? What for? Did you break the glass?\" But fortunately, I managed to persuade him to give me a band-aid.\n\nWe finished tidying up and went to bed, but around 6 AM, we woke up to a fire alarm. We evacuated, and other people were also outside. The aggressive staff member was walking around looking for the issue. There was a fire alarm panel next to the reception, and a female guest seemed to check the alarm error and turn it off, explaining to the staff member how to use it. After this incident, we returned to try and sleep more, but the fire alarm went off several more times after thirty minutes.\n\nAt checkout, we returned our keycards, and although I don’t know how they handled other guests, we received no apology. Whether they were racist or just generally rude, we felt deeply disappointed by their lack of basic courtesy towards customers. We just hope no one else has to suffer the same experience as us.","published_at":"11 months ago","published_at_date":"2024-07-30T19:52:32","response_from_owner_text":null,"response_from_owner_ago":null,"response_from_owner_date":null,"total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer":3,"total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer":1,"is_local_guide":false,"review_translated_text":null,"response_from_owner_translated_text":null,"experience_details":[{"name":"Trip type","value":"Holiday"},{"name":"Travel group","value":"Friends"},{"name":"Rooms","value":2},{"name":"Service","value":1},{"name":"Location","value":3}],"review_photos":[]},{"review_id":"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKanVqZTdRRRAB","review_link":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKanVqZTdRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xcf0635e647d2c474!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDJjuje7QE%7CCgsI6IfSpQYQ0OqxKw%7C?hl=en-GB","name":"Débora Moraes","reviewer_id":"107189131679424255529","reviewer_profile":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107189131679424255529?hl=en-GB","rating":4,"review_text":"My husband and I stayed at Yugo in June of 2023.

There was a 'common' room with a TV and cooking facilities well kitted out.  Beautiful view from our room overlooking the River Lee and the facility was very secure.  Bus stop to location where function was happening was only 5 mins walk away    and route went via city centre.  Very nice take aways and restaurants within easy walking from the hotel too.  Staff at reception on arrival and departure were extremely friendly and helpful.  On check out receptionist validated our parking ticket with carpark close by and this saved us quite a bit in parking fees.  I most definitely would recommend this hostel if your looking for accomadation in Cork City - no frills, clean, secure, friendly staff and close to most attractions in area.
